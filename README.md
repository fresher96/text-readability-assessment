# Text Readability Assessment

Project idea: build a system that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to automatically assess texts readability, i.e. to answer the question: is the given text hard/easy/etc. to read?  
The system was built using data mining/machine learning algorithms combined with NLP.  
Achieved state-of-the-art result using SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifiers on features extracted using NLP.
